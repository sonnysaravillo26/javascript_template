/* What is Async 
    1 . When we append the keyword "async" to the function, this function
    retruns the "Promise" by default on execution. 

    2. Async keyword provides extra information to the user of the function:
        - The function contains some Asynchronous Execution
        - The returned value will be the Resolved Value for the Promise.
